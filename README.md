# How to customize the resource view in the Flutter Calendar?

A quick-start example to help you to customize the resource view in the Flutter Calendar.

Using the resourceViewSettings properties in the calendar, you can customize the timeline resource view in the Flutter Event Calendar. Customize the resources by using displayNameTextStyle, showAvatar, size, visibleResourceCount properties in the ResourceViewSettings. You can find the more details about these properties from below,

## Show avatar

By setting the [showAvatar](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/ResourceViewSettings/showAvatar.html) value in the ResourceViewSettings to false, you can turn off the user avatar and the circle that represents the resource. This will show the name of each resource as well as the color that has been given to it.

## Display name text style

The display name text style for the resource view can be customized by setting an appropriate text style to the [displayNameTextStyle](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/ResourceViewSettings/displayNameTextStyle.html) property available in the ResourceViewSettings.

## Resource panel size

You can customize the size of the panel that displays the resource views in the calendar by setting an appropriate value to the [size](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/ResourceViewSettings/size.html) property

## Visible resource count

You can customize the number of visible resources in the current view using the [visibleResourceCount](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/ResourceViewSettings/visibleResourceCount.html) property.
